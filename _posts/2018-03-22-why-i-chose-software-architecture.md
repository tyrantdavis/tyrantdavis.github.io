    <p><b><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> am a tinkerer and naturally curious about my environment.  I remember taking apart gaming systems, computers, or anything I could get my hands on. I just had to know how things worked. That feeling still rules me. <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarg">I</span></b> have always questioned my surroundings demanding to know and understand the meaning of it all.

    <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">W</span></b>hen I was young, I would sneak on to the roof at night and just stare at the stars wondering how it all worked.  Sorry mother. I would ask questions such as what are the mechanics of the universe? How does this all fit together? How does nature know when to do this to get that? What is the force that drives nature? How is life possible? Seriously. Those questions eventually led me to the realization that patterns were the key to my understanding. Surely I would never know everything - not even remotely close to it.  I thought that if I could just isolate and understand the patterns a lot would be revealed - that was the plan at least. So I started paying attention to nature’s cycles: night and day, the four seasons, weather, the wave cycle, the precessions of the equinox, etc. when many never contemplate, consider or question such things. This may sound boring to you, but it excites me. Nature is the best teacher after all.

    <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> eventually realized that all of life is patterns.
    Where there is a pattern there is a set of instructions for repeating a desired result. I approached everything with the concept of patterns in mind from then on. I am willing to bet this all sounds familiar to you even if you cannot put a name on the concept. I too did not fully understand that I was toying with the concept of algorithms in my earlier years.… They are everywhere and drive everything.

      <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">F</span></b>ast forward a few years, I am working as a Health Information Technology manager. I was tasked with taking over a failing program. Once I had the program running smoothly and excelling, I became anxious and began looking for my next challenge. This was a consequence of me constantly needing a challenge to feel alive.   Many of you are probably wondering why I would transition from a managerial role into software development. Well, that position is actually were my journey into software development as a profession began.

    <p>
      <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> always had an affinity for understanding the technology behind the programs I administered. I also wondered about all the technology I used daily including music production apps, games, scheduling apps, my work out apps, etc. I used and enjoyed technology so much that I felt compelled to learn about it. At times I actually felt as if I had a responsibility to learn it. That was just me putting too much pressure on myself as I often do. Was that me never letting go of the need to understand my environment? Either way, I did lots of research of the technologies behind the programs I administered daily. The more I unearthed, the more I became infatuated with software development. This eventually led me back down a path I did not realize I had started much earlier in my life. Chances are you too started down the road much earlier than you know.

      <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">W</span></b>hy have I said all of this? Well, through my research I discovered that I had been practicing many of the habits of a software developer all these years.  For instance, I mentioned that I am naturally curious and that leads one to seek, discover, and to asking questions. Questions lead to research, hopefully. I am a natural researcher and found that was a very important skill for software development. The time I spent studying nature gave me more tools than I ever knew. I have a builders mind. I love building things in fact. I built a recording desk for my music studio. I had no prior knowledge or experience with carpentry. I did have a vision, an understanding of math, weight, and dimensions though. I knew how to use a hammer, tape measure, drill, screw driver, etc.  I am no Jean-Michel Basquiat, but I could draw well enough to render the layout on paper. Most of all, I just knew what I wanted; that too is a skill. Again, I was no carpenter. I just had a goal, a plan, an understanding of concepts that fundamentally apply to all of life i.e. math, physics, weight, etc., and a desire to see the project through.

      <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> am a tinkerer with an insatiable need to open things up to understand how they work, and that is nothing more than being an explorer who is detailed. This can sometimes be to my detriment too. I have had to learn not to go further into the rabbit hole than necessary, which is easier than you think, especially when you are someone that obsesses over every little detail.

      <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">Y</span></b>ou can probably tell that I am a lifelong learner.  That is a very important skill in software development. I love to solve problems, it is a big part of what I do enthusiastically as an operations manager; and, it was a part of what I did well as a HIT manger.  I love to challenge myself. It makes me feel alive, though it can be trying at times. It is great to have practice challenging yourself because there are challenges all the time. Trust me!

      <b class="wide"><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b>  have a breath of interests, and that suits me well in this industry.  Considering that all industries depend on technology, there is enormous value in having varied interests and a plethora of opportunities that go along with it. Innovation is found between technology and all the other interest we have in our lives.  I like to think of it as the Goldilocks Zone of ingenuity. There is another nature reference we can relate to. Best teacher ever!

      <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> welcome change.I know it is cliché, but I do believe it is the spice of life.  Things change all the time, and quickly, in this industry. If you are adverse to change, things may be very difficult for you.

      <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b> was naturally inclined to think in terms of algorithms as evidenced in the beginning of this article. I look for patterns in everything. This is not relegated to software architecture; Patterns apply to everything in life. Lastly, I do not give up. You will need that because you will fail often, but if you have the tenacity and patience to stay with it you will eventually break through. Perseverance is paramount.

      <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">Y</span></b>ou do not need some epic story or reason why you chose this path. If you have the passion and the drive, go for it! Do not allow your reservations to hold you back. You are guaranteed to never succeed at the things you do not attempt. Let’s get back to why I chose this path. I just happened to unearth qualities of mine that fit software architecture very well, and, software architecture happens to embrace a lot of the things that make me who I am, including my varied interests. As John Muir says, “In every walk with nature one receives far more than s/he seeks.”

    <p>
      <b><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b>n conclusion, I encourage you to do an inventory of your life. You may discover that you already have what it takes. I hope my story helps you along your journey. Embrace change. 

      Happy Coding!
