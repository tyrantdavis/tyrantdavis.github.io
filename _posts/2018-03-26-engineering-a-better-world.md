<!-- <span class="center">![Entertainment Apps](/img/post_images/entertainment-apps.jpeg) </span> -->
<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>he way we consume entertainment is rapidly changing. We have apps that allow us to game with others around the globe. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Extended Reality, and Mixed Reality are taking gaming to new heights. We are no longer dependent on the cable-TV for great entertainment. Apps like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and others have brought about dramatic change.

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>he Internet Of Things is changing our lives and making everything smarter.  It allows us to design and build smarter homes, for example.  It is also impacting sports. Teams are using sensors on athletic equipment and on athletes that provide performance feedback. Even sports venues are impacted by the Internet Of Things. It is still a fairly new paradigm, but the potential is enormous.

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>echnology is very powerful, and with great power comes even greater responsibility. Software engineers have an ability to affect the world like no other. That is becoming more evident with each day passed. Much of our lives depend on technology; it is completely interwoven into most aspects of our lives. The examples above are only the tip of the iceberg, and it will only increase with time. The world is changing, and software and engineers are at the forefront!
